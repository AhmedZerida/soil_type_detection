# Soil Type Classification Model

## Overview

This project aims to classify soil types using machine learning techniques. The model has been trained on a dataset containing 1215 images belonging to 4 classes and tested on 340 files belonging to the same 4 classes. It achieves a test accuracy of approximately 97%. The dataset used for training and testing can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhislainematchouath/soil-types-dataset).

## Dataset Information

- **Number of Training Images:** 1215
- **Number of Test Images:** 340
- **Number of Classes:** 4
- **Test Accuracy:** ~97%

### Classes:

1. Alluvial soil
2. Black Soil
3. Clay soil
4. Red soil

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for this project is a custom architecture designed for soil type classification.
## Usage

This model can be used to classify soil types based on input images. It has been trained to then take the result with other inputs for an expert system to make a suggestion for the next plant to plant.
